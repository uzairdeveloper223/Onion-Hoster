## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-XX - Manual Tor Startup Release

### üéâ Major New Features

#### Manual Tor Startup with Bootstrap Monitoring
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Watch Tor bootstrap from 0% to 100%
- **Live Status Messages**: See exactly what Tor is doing at each stage
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Termux
- **Direct Tor Control**: Runs Tor directly instead of via systemctl
- **Immediate Address Generation**: Get your .onion address as soon as Tor reaches 100%

#### Bootstrap Progress Display
- CLI: Beautiful progress bar with percentage and status messages
- GUI: Real-time progress bar widget with live updates
- Status messages show connection stages:
  - "Connecting to directory servers"
  - "Loading relay descriptors"
  - "Requesting network status"
  - "Establishing circuits"
  - "Done!"

### ‚ú® Added

- `start_tor_manual()` method for direct Tor process control
- Bootstrap progress monitoring with regex parsing
- Progress callback system for GUI/CLI integration
- `test_manual_tor.py` - Standalone test script demonstrating new features
- `MANUAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive technical documentation
- Platform-specific Tor user detection (`_get_tor_user()`, `_get_tor_group()`)
- Automatic `.onion` address reading after bootstrap completion
- Threading for non-blocking bootstrap monitoring
- Enhanced error messages with bootstrap progress information

### üîß Changed

- `start_service()` now uses manual Tor startup instead of systemctl
- Modified to accept `progress_callback` parameter for real-time updates
- `stop_tor()` now handles both manual process and systemctl service
- `get_service_status()` includes `tor_running` and `bootstrap_progress` fields
- Improved permission handling for hidden service directories
- Better cross-platform path handling (Windows, Termux, macOS, Linux)

### üêõ Fixed

- **Permission Issues**: Automatic `chmod 700` for hidden service directories
- **Ownership Problems**: Correct user/group assignment based on distribution
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `debian-tor:debian-tor`
  - Arch/Fedora: `tor:tor`
  - macOS: Current user
  - Termux: No ownership change needed
- **Service Detection**: Proper detection of Debian's `tor@default` vs regular `tor` service
- **Bootstrap Timeout**: Service now waits for actual 100% instead of guessing
- **Address Generation**: Guaranteed .onion address availability after bootstrap
- **Multi-Instance Tor**: Correctly handles Ubuntu's multi-instance Tor setup

### üìù Improved

- More detailed logging throughout Tor startup process
- Better error messages with specific troubleshooting steps
- Enhanced status reporting with bootstrap information
- Clearer user feedback during service startup
- Platform-specific command generation

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

#### Platform-Specific Tor Commands

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo -u debian-tor tor -f /etc/tor/torrc
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash

- .onion addresses are guaranteed to be available after startup
- Stopping services now handles both manual and systemctl methods

**New features you can use:**
```python
# Use progress callback for custom UI
def my_progress(progress, message):
    print(f"{progress}% - {message}")

success, msg, address = service.start_service(
    "/path/to/site",
    progress_callback=my_progress
)
```

**Config file changes:**
- No changes to config.json format
- Additional status fields available in `get_service_status()`

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Bootstrap Timeout**: Currently set to 120 seconds. May need adjustment for slow connections.
2. **Windows**: Requires manual Tor Expert Bundle installation
3. **Termux**: X11 support needed for GUI mode
4. **macOS**: May require Homebrew for easiest installation
